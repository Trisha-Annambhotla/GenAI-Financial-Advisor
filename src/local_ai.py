You are a personal finance advisor.

A user has the following financial details:
- Monthly Income: {income}
- Spending on Needs: {needs}
- Spending on Wants: {wants}
- Monthly Savings Goal: {savings_goal}

Based on this information, generate 3 specific and practical financial tips to help them reduce spending, save more, and improve their financial health.

Write the tips in a numbered list. Do not repeat the input. Be detailed and helpful.
tips:
1. **Cut down on non-essentials**  
Your spending on wants is 30% of your income. Try reducing this by 10â€“15%, focusing on things like dining out or shopping. Reallocate the saved money into your savings goal.

2. **Automate savings**  
Set up an automatic monthly transfer of $800 directly into your savings account as soon as your paycheck hits. This makes saving effortless and ensures you meet your target.

3. **Reevaluate fixed costs**  
Check if you can cut down on fixed expenses like rent or utilities. Even small changes like switching insurance providers or renegotiating rent could free up additional funds for savings.
